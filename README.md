🌟 Internship Experience Reflection
The SmartBridge Virtual Internship was a valuable and enriching experience.

When I started this internship, I had zero prior knowledge of Tableau. However, through the structured learning path, hands-on assignments, and project work, I now feel confident in using Tableau to create professional dashboards, stories, and data visualizations.

This internship has significantly improved my technical skills and boosted my confidence in working with real-world datasets.

Thank you, SmartBridge, for making me knowledgeable and skilled in Tableau.

📌 Project Highlights
Entire project — from dataset analysis to dashboard and story creation — was independently completed by Vegesna Monika Aishwarya.

Repository includes all supporting files: datasets, Tableau workbook, visual outputs, reports, and video demonstration.

A comprehensive data analytics project, ideal for portfolio showcasing.

Submitted as part of the SmartBridge Virtual Internship – Data Analytics with Tableau.
