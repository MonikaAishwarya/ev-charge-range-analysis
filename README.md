###🚗 Electric Vehicle Charge & Range Analysis — Data Analytics Project###
Welcome to the Electric Vehicle Charge & Range Analysis project repository.
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) data using Tableau to provide key insights about EVs in India and globally.

##📋 Project Overview$$
The Electric Vehicle (EV) industry is evolving rapidly, driven by advances in battery technology, EV analytics, and charging infrastructure.

This project analyzes datasets from various sources to visualize:

EV market trends

Charging station distribution

Pricing

Efficiency

Vehicle specifications

##🎯 Project Objectives##
Analyze EV market trends using real-world datasets.

Visualize the distribution of EV charging stations in India.

Compare EV car models by speed, price, efficiency, and other parameters.

Summarize EV availability by brand, body style, and drivetrain type.

Create clear dashboards and stories to present the findings.

##🌟 Internship Experience Reflection##
The SmartBridge Virtual Internship was a valuable learning experience.

When I started this internship, I had no prior knowledge of Tableau. Through the structured learning modules, hands-on assignments, and this final project, I gained confidence in using Tableau to create dashboards, stories, and data visualizations.

This internship improved my technical and analytical skills and gave me real-world data experience.

Thank you, SmartBridge, for this learning opportunity.

##📌 Project Highlights##
The entire project—from dataset analysis to dashboards and stories—was completed independently by Vegesna Monika Aishwarya.

Repository contains all project resources: datasets, Tableau files, screenshots, reports, video demonstration, and assignments.

A complete, portfolio-ready data analytics project.

Submitted as part of the SmartBridge Virtual Internship – Data Analytics with Tableau.
