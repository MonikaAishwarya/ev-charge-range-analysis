## 🌟 Internship Experience Reflection

The **SmartBridge Virtual Internship** was a valuable learning experience.

When I started this internship, I had no prior knowledge of **Tableau**. Through the structured learning modules, hands-on assignments, and this final project, I gained confidence in using Tableau to create dashboards, stories, and data visualizations.

This internship improved my **technical** and **analytical** skills and gave me real-world data experience.

**Thank you, SmartBridge, for this learning opportunity.**
