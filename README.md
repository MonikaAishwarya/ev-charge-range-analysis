🌟 Internship Experience Reflection
🎓 The SmartBridge Virtual Internship has been an incredibly enriching experience!

I started this internship with zero prior knowledge of Tableau. However, through their structured learning, hands-on assignments, and project work, I now feel confident in using Tableau to create professional dashboards, stories, and compelling data visualizations.

This internship has significantly boosted my technical skills, sharpened my data analysis abilities, and improved my confidence in working with real-world data.

💡 Huge thanks to SmartBridge for making me skilled and knowledgeable in Tableau!
